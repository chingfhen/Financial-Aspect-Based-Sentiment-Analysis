# Financial-Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis


In this research project:
• I developed a granular level sentiment prediction model that predicts the sentiments of S&P500 companies at high accuracy
• Performed data augmentation, feature engineering and domain-adaptation techniques, which improved the system performance by **over 30%**
• Performed data collection through web scraping and API calls
• Performed manual data annotation to construct an aspect based sentiment analysis dataset
• Performed extensive academic research and analysis on aspect based sentiment analysis

This project was part of the **NTU URECA Research Program** which i achieved a **Distinction**.

Additional notes:

The motivation of this project was to develop a sentiment analysis model that traders could use to determine the sentiment towards the stocks that they are interested in. Traditional sentiment analysis is usually sentence or document level, however sometimes there are multiple sentiments inside a single sentence, which make ABSA advantageous. Furthermore, this machine learning pipeline I implement allows user's to specify the exact stock they're interested in, making the end application more flexible and user friendly (traditionally ABSA models extract all sentiments, but this pipeline i develop only extract sentiments of specified aspects, allowing a more targeted and efficient workflow).
